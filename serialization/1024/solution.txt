notice that you can retrieve the php files thought a path traversal:
- go to play and change color (there is a blue botton on the tile of the game)
- then edit the url in this way:
  http://1024.training.jinblack.it/?color=../viewer.php
  here, you can inspect the element and on the style you will find the source code of viewer.php
  there you will find the name of the page inngerGame.php
  http://1024.training.jinblack.it/?color=../inngerGame.php	
  Finally, in this page there is all the serialized classes
- notice that you can load you game which is a serialized class
- you can serialize a ranking object crafting it in a way that it will save the env.var. in a certain page
- when the object ranking is destroyed then it creates everything
- so load the file and just check if it is printed in the special page (the one specified in the craft)
  just by inspecting the page 
  http://1024.training.jinblack.it/?color=../games/hello3.php
- Finally, if it is printed, go to  http://1024.training.jinblack.it/games/hello3.php
